## <a name="cc"></a>Code of Content

References are formed in sources in different languages, you can continue with the type of content that is most suitable for your progress. It is worth noting that we recommend you to prioritize foreign language sources for the most up-to-date content.

While some students feel more comfortable progressing from written sources, some students are better at following from video recordings!

📑 -> Written source <br>
🎥 -> Video source <br>
📝 -> Exercise contents <br>
👤 -> Profile or Channel <br>
🗺️ -> Roadmap or Chart <br>

These contents are independent of the curriculum but are contents recommended to be followed along with the curriculum. They are all created by volunteer content producers and continue as open source. Please do not forget to follow and like the producers of the content you do not have difficulty in following and think it is useful.

The estimated times you need to allocate and repeat while following the sources are indicated next to them. These times may vary from person to person!

While examining the content, who is responsible for these contents and who recommends you to read is stated in the responsible part, if you encounter any difficulty or error, please contact the relevant person.
